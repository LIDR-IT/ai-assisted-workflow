# Simple:

#
# With body:
# fix(api): resolve timeout on user endpoint
#
# Added retry logic with exponential backoff to prevent
# timeout errors when database is under high load.
#
# Fixes: #234
#
# With breaking change:
# feat(api): change authentication flow
#
# Redesigned authentication to use JWT tokens instead of
# session-based authentication for better scalability.
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: All auth endpoints changed. Clients must
# update to use /auth/login and include JWT in Authorization
# header for subsequent requests.

# Closes: #567
