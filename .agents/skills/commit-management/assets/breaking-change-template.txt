# ===== Breaking Change Commit Template =====
#
# Use this template when making changes that break backward compatibility
#
# CRITICAL: Breaking changes trigger a MAJOR version bump (1.x.x -> 2.0.0)
# in Semantic Versioning. Only use when absolutely necessary.
#
# ===== When to Use =====
#
# - Changing public API signatures
# - Removing features or endpoints
# - Changing response formats
# - Modifying behavior of existing features
# - Upgrading dependencies with breaking changes
# - Changing configuration requirements
#
# ===== Required Elements =====
#
# 1. Type and scope (usually "feat" for breaking features)
# 2. Clear subject line
# 3. Body explaining the change
# 4. BREAKING CHANGE footer (REQUIRED)
# 5. Migration instructions or guide reference
#
# ===== BREAKING CHANGE Footer =====
#
# Format:
# BREAKING CHANGE: [Description]
#
# Must include:
# - What changed
# - How it affects users
# - Why the change was necessary (if not obvious from body)
#
# ===== Migration Instructions =====
#
# Provide either:
# A. Inline step-by-step migration instructions
# B. Reference to detailed migration guide document
#
# Migration guide should include:
# - Before/after code examples
# - Step-by-step instructions
# - Troubleshooting common issues
# - Timeline for deprecated features
#
# ===== Examples =====
#
# API Change:
# feat(api): redesign authentication endpoints
#
# Complete redesign of authentication API for improved security
# and better developer experience.
#
# Changes:
# - POST /auth/login now returns JWT token instead of session cookie
# - Added POST /auth/refresh for token refresh
# - POST /auth/logout now requires Authorization header
# - Removed /session/* endpoints
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication flow completely changed from
# session-based to JWT-based. All API clients must migrate to new
# authentication flow.
#
# Migration steps:
# 1. Update login calls to use POST /auth/login
# 2. Store returned JWT token securely
# 3. Include token in Authorization header: "Bearer <token>"
# 4. Implement token refresh using POST /auth/refresh
# 5. Remove session cookie handling
#
# Detailed migration guide: docs/migration/v2-auth.md
#
# Old sessions will be supported until 2025-12-31, then removed.
#
# Closes: #567
# Refs: #543, #234

#
# Dependency Update:
# chore(deps): update Node.js to v18 LTS
#
# Update minimum Node.js version from v14 to v18 LTS to enable
# use of modern JavaScript features and improved performance.
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: Node.js v14 and v16 are no longer supported.
# Minimum required version is now Node.js v18.
#
# Migration: Install Node.js v18 or higher before upgrading.
#
# Check your version:
# $ node --version
#
# Upgrade using nvm:
# $ nvm install 18
# $ nvm use 18
#
# Or download from: https://nodejs.org/
#
# Closes: #890
#

#
# Data Format Change:
# feat(api): standardize error response format
#
# Implement consistent error response format across all API
# endpoints for better error handling in clients.
#
# All errors now return:
# {
#   "error": {
#     "code": "ERROR_CODE",
#     "message": "Human readable message",
#     "details": {}
#   }
# }
#
# BREAKING CHANGE: Error response format changed. Clients must
# update error handling to use new error object structure.
#
# Before:
# { "error": "Error message" }
#
# After:
# { "error": { "code": "ERROR_CODE", "message": "Error message" } }
#
# Migration: Update error handling code to access error.message
# instead of error.
#
# See: docs/api/error-handling.md
#
# Closes: #234
# Refs: #456, #789
