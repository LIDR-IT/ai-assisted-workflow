# LIDR → BMad Consolidation (2026-05-19)

This document tracks the migration of 17 `lidr-*` skills into BMad equivalents and where their unique assets live now.

## Phase A — 10 orphan skills deleted (no assets, no refs)

These had no unique templates, scripts, or active references. Deleted outright:

| Deleted LIDR                 | BMad replacement                               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `lidr-brainstorming`         | `bmad-brainstorming`                           |
| `lidr-domain-research`       | `bmad-domain-research`                         |
| `lidr-technical-research`    | `bmad-technical-research`                      |
| `lidr-bdd-patterns`          | `bmad-testarch-atdd`                           |
| `lidr-skill-development`     | `bmad-workflow-builder` + `bmad-agent-builder` |
| `lidr-agent-development`     | `bmad-agent-builder`                           |
| `lidr-multi-agent-audit`     | `bmad-eval-runner` + `bmad-party-mode`         |
| `lidr-document-discovery`    | `bmad-document-project` + `bmad-shard-doc`     |
| `lidr-design-doc`            | `bmad-create-architecture`                     |
| `lidr-implementation-phases` | `bmad-sprint-planning`                         |

## Phase B — 7 skills migrated and deleted

These had real assets (templates, Python scripts) worth preserving even though BMad covers the workflow better:

### `lidr-architecture-doc` → `bmad-create-architecture`

Templates moved to `.agents/_shared/lidr/templates/architecture/`:

- `architecture.md` — top-level architecture doc
- `db-schema.md` — DB schema template
- `data-model.md` — data model template
- `specs/routes.md`, `specs/components.md`, `specs/storage.md` — 5-level spec templates

**How to use:** When `bmad-create-architecture` finishes, copy templates to `docs/projects/<name>/` as starting structure.

### `lidr-epic-breakdown` → `bmad-create-epics-and-stories`

- Template: `.agents/_shared/lidr/templates/epic.md` (Spanish epic format)
- Rules reference: `.agents/_shared/lidr/references/epic-decomposition-rules.md` (sizing thresholds, grouping criteria, Enabler Epic concept)

**How to use:** Reference both files when invoking `bmad-create-epics-and-stories` for projects following the LIDR Gate model.

### `lidr-ux-design-spec` → `bmad-ux`

- Template: `.agents/_shared/lidr/templates/ux-design-spec.md`
- Custom rule: "Every screen has 4+ states (default/loading/empty/error)"

### `lidr-skill-creator` → `bmad-agent-builder` + `bmad-eval-runner`

Anthropic upstream archive at `.agents/_shared/anthropic/skill-creator/` (includes LICENSE.txt, eval-viewer web UI, 8 Python scripts).

**Why archive:** It IS Anthropic's official skill-creator (per LICENSE.txt). Preserved for reference but not used in new skill creation — BMad's eval-runner has Docker isolation + parallel graders (methodologically superior).

### `lidr-test-plan` → `bmad-testarch-test-design`

Python scripts moved to `.agents/_shared/lidr/scripts/test-automation/`:

- `risk-analyzer.py` (829 lines) — auto-discovers PRDs/RFs/NFRs and scores complexity
- `test-strategy-generator.py` (963 lines) — generates phased test strategy with entry/exit criteria

**Warning:** Scripts have biometric domain hardcoded (`{{SENSITIVE_DATA_TYPE}}` and similar). Make them fully domain-agnostic before reusing in new projects.

### `lidr-regression-suite` → `bmad-testarch-automate` + `bmad-testarch-trace`

Python scripts moved to `.agents/_shared/lidr/scripts/regression/`:

- `impact-analyzer.py` (328 lines) — git diff → component impact radius
- `dependency-mapper.py` (433 lines) — module dependency graph

**How to use:** Invoke from `bmad-testarch-automate` workflow to identify which regression tests must run for a given PR.

### `lidr-retrospective` → `bmad-retrospective`

No asset migration needed. BMad's retro is 1513 lines (vs LIDR's 149) with Party Mode and epic-scope facilitation.

**Lost when deleting LIDR:** Sprint-level retro with metrics-first principle (Jira velocity, GitHub PR cycle time, QA pass rate). Re-introduce as a customization prepend if needed.

## Skills KEPT (no migration — LIDR substantively unique)

| LIDR (kept)              | Why kept                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lidr-pr-description`    | No BMad equivalent. DoD checklist (`checklists/dod.md`) is wired into hook `dtc-write-guard` and `/lidr-advance-gate 4`.                            |
| `lidr-user-stories`      | `scripts/rf-slicer.py` (1184 lines): 8 slicing patterns + INVEST + Jira CSV export. BMad stories are dev-agent fodder, not Jira-ready PO artifacts. |
| `lidr-create-test-cases` | Xray-importable QA test cases. BMad ATDD generates code scaffolds for devs — different role, different deliverable.                                 |

## Phase D — Repositioning LIDR as thin BMad complement (2026-05-20)

**Architectural shift:** LIDR is no longer a parallel methodology — it becomes a thin pre/post wrapper layer on top of BMad's base flow. Skills that competed with BMad workflows are removed; those that complement (pre/post wrappers, Gate enforcement, compliance, automation) are kept and reframed.

### Additional deletions (7 skills)

| Deleted LIDR               | BMad substitute / outcome                                                                           | Template migrated to `_shared/lidr/templates/` |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `lidr-prd-funcional`       | `bmad-prd` (intent: create) becomes Gate 1 input. `lidr-review-cruzado` validates F-section.        | `prd-funcional.md`                             |
| `lidr-prd-tecnico`         | `bmad-prd` becomes Gate 1 input. `lidr-review-cruzado` validates T-section.                         | `prd-tecnico.md`, `prd-system-design.md`       |
| `lidr-epic-review`         | `bmad-retrospective` (10× larger, covers post-epic review with lessons learned).                    | `epic-review.md`                               |
| `lidr-poc-report`          | `bmad-technical-research` covers technical validation. GO/NO-GO documented as invocation guideline. | (no template)                                  |
| `lidr-use-cases`           | Embedded inside `bmad-create-prd` output (BMad PRD already includes use cases section).             | `use-cases.md`                                 |
| `lidr-business-model`      | `bmad-prfaq` (Working Backwards) covers business positioning.                                       | `business-model.md`                            |
| `lidr-changelog-generator` | Consolidated into `lidr-release-notes` (3-level: exec + technical + customer in one skill).         | (no template)                                  |

### SKILL.md reframe (no deletion, reposition as wrapper)

`lidr-review-cruzado` description rewritten to make its new role explicit: **Gate 1 enforcer that validates bmad-prd output has both F+T sections complete**. Other LIDR wrappers (generate-rf, generate-nfr, user-stories, sprint-capacity, pr-description, release-notes, gate-evaluation) keep their existing descriptions which already document their pre/post role; full reframe is follow-up doc work.

### Criticality classification

Every LIDR skill now has a `criticality` field (`required` | `recommended` | `optional`) classifying it relative to BMad coverage. See `.agents/_shared/lidr/CRITICALITY.md` for the public reference. Each Artifact in HelpCenter (`/aramis/help`) shows a colored badge: 🔴 OBLIGATORIO / 🟡 RECOMENDABLE / 🟢 OPCIONAL.

### Repo cleanup

- Deleted `app/.claude/` (109 pre-merge stale symlinks)
- Deleted `app/.claude-env` (auto-generated by load-context hook, untracked)
- Moved `app/.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` → `.github/workflows/test-coverage.yml` (GitHub Actions only reads from repo root); added `working-directory: ./app` to all `npm` steps and `cache-dependency-path: app/package-lock.json` for setup-node so it actually runs.

### `_bmad/` framework committed

The BMad Method framework (`_bmad/`, 21 files, 304K) is now tracked — required for all 69 bmad-\* skills to resolve their step-files and configs.

## Final inventory (Phase A + B + C + D)

```
Before Phase A: 62 LIDR
After Phase A (10 orphan deletions): 52 LIDR
After Phase B (7 migrated + deleted):  45 LIDR
After Phase C (anytime registered):    45 LIDR + 69 BMad + 4 anytime = 118
After Phase D (7 parallel-flow deleted): 38 LIDR + 69 BMad + 4 anytime = 111
```

Final LIDR breakdown by criticality:

- 🔴 OBLIGATORIO: 23 (BMad doesn't cover; cannot be skipped)
- 🟡 RECOMENDABLE: 9 (BMad covers partially; LIDR adds automation/Spanish/Gate-binding)
- 🟢 OPCIONAL: 6 (niche use cases; only activate when relevant)

Plus 4 anytime skills (agents-architecture, command-development, commit-management, ticket-validation) all OPCIONAL.

## Phase E — Claude Code meta-tooling rename (2026-05-20)

**Context:** 5 skills in `.agents/skills/` are not LIDR methodology — they extend the Claude Code platform itself (rules, hooks, MCP, commands, agents architecture). Renamed with `claude-` prefix to make this explicit and moved from `source: 'lidr'` to `source: 'anytime'`.

### Renames (5)

| Before                  | After                      | Source change         | Notes                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `agents-architecture`   | `lidr-agents-architecture` | `anytime` (no change) | Meta entry-point for `.agents/` system |
| `command-development`   | `lidr-command-development` | `anytime` (no change) | Slash command authoring                |
| `lidr-generate-rule`    | `lidr-generate-rule`       | `lidr` → `anytime`    | Claude Code rule files                 |
| `lidr-hook-development` | `lidr-hook-development`    | `lidr` → `anytime`    | PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop hooks      |
| `lidr-mcp-integration`  | `lidr-mcp-integration`     | `lidr` → `anytime`    | MCP server config                      |

### Why

These 5 skills extend the Claude Code platform — they're not LIDR methodology (Gate G0-G7) and not BMad (base flow). The `lidr-` prefix was misleading: it implied they were part of the LIDR SDLC, but they could be used by any Claude Code project regardless of methodology. The `claude-` prefix correctly identifies them as platform extensions.

### Updates

- 5 directories renamed in `.agents/skills/` via `git mv`
- `name:` frontmatter updated in each `SKILL.md`
- `skills.ts`: id/name/docPath updated; 3 entries moved from `source: 'lidr'` to `source: 'anytime'`
- `.agents/rules/tools/claude-code-extensions.md`: table + Invoke references updated
- `CRITICALITY.md`: OPCIONAL table reorganized to show the 5 as anytime/claude-\*

### Future work

Pending in `TODO.md`: verify each renamed skill against the latest Anthropic upstream Claude Code skill (via `npx ctx7@latest docs /anthropic/claude-code`) and merge any improvements. Personalized sections should be marked with `<!-- LIDR customization -->` blocks for future upstream syncs.

## Phase F — Prefix unprefixed + 4 LIDR refactors + BMad sitemap restructure (2026-05-20)

**Context:** Final cleanup pass after Phase E. The user requested:

1. The 2 remaining unprefixed skills (`commit-management`, `ticket-validation`) should get `lidr-` prefix and move from `source: 'anytime'` to `source: 'lidr'` for consistency.
2. Restructure the sitemap UI (`sitemapView.ts`) so BMad skills are grouped by the **official BMad phases** documented in Vol I-V (`docs/guides/bmad/`), not collapsed as "+117 more".
3. Re-audit the 35 LIDR skills with BMad as source of truth and refactor any redundant ones as thin wrappers over BMad outputs.

### Renames (2)

| Before              | After                    | Source change      | Criticality   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `commit-management` | `lidr-commit-management` | `anytime` → `lidr` | `optional`    |
| `ticket-validation` | `lidr-ticket-validation` | `anytime` → `lidr` | `recommended` |

`lidr-ticket-validation` was upgraded to `recommended` (was optional) because it validates LIDR/BMad ticket structure pre-PR — has real value in the flow, not just niche.

### 4 LIDR SKILL.md refactors (thin-wrapper framing)

Each `description:` was rewritten to make the wrap explicit:

- `lidr-project-classifier` — removed; replaced by `bmad-document-project` (classifies project type + derives doc requirements via its project-types.csv / documentation-requirements.csv).
- `lidr-refinement-notes` — POST-BMAD WRAPPER: consumes user stories from `bmad-create-story` and captures DoR-readiness grooming notes.
- `lidr-bug-report` — QA→DEV WRAPPER: while `bmad-investigate` is Dev-internal forensic, this is QA-facing outbound bug report.
- `lidr-audit-standards` — ECOSYSTEM-SCOPE WRAPPER over `bmad-review-adversarial-general` (which reviews content). This audits `.agents/` structure: frontmatter, drift, paths.

No directory or functionality changes — only description refactor to clarify role in the BMad-base + LIDR-complement architecture.

### Sitemap restructure (app/src/data/features/sitemapView.ts)

Removed the "+117 more" placeholder. Added two new top-level nodes:

1. **Claude meta-tooling (anytime)** — 5 `claude-*` skills with explicit nature ("Skills para extender la plataforma Claude Code, no LIDR, no BMad").
2. **BMad — Base flow (69 skills)** — full tree organized by BMad Vol I-V official phases:
   - Fase 0 — Aprendizaje (1)
   - Fase 1 — Análisis (6)
   - Fase 2 — Planificación (4)
   - Fase 3 — Solución (6)
   - Fase 4 — Implementación (10)
   - Toolkit Anytime (3)
   - Brownfield (4)
   - Persona Agents — BMM + TEA (7)
   - Persona Agents — CIS (6)
   - CIS Workflows (4)
   - BMad Builder (BMB) — Meta (4)
   - Core Utilities (13)

Visible across all clients (`/facephi/sitemap`, `/aramis/sitemap`, `/docline/sitemap`, `/base/sitemap`) since `sitemapView.ts` is shared.

### Re-audit summary

After reading BMad Vol I-V and cross-referencing all 35 LIDR skills with the 69 BMad skills:

- **0 DELETE candidates** — every LIDR skill survives the audit
- **4 REFACTOR candidates** done in this phase (above)
- LIDR architecture is sound: BMad covers the base flow (69 skills); LIDR adds 35 skills for Gate enforcement (G0-G7), security/compliance, pre/post wrappers, and consultancy multi-client tooling

### Updates

- 2 dirs renamed in `.agents/skills/` via `git mv`
- 2 SKILL.md `name:` fields updated
- 4 SKILL.md `description:` fields refactored as thin-wrapper framing
- `app/src/data/artifacts/skills.ts` — 2 ids/names/docPaths/sources/criticality updated
- `app/src/data/features/sitemapView.ts` — ~150 new TreeNodes; placeholder removed
- `CRITICALITY.md` — table reorganized to reflect renames + wrapper notes
- `TODO.md` — items completed in this phase marked as done

## Final inventory (after Phase F)

```
LIDR:    36 skills (23 OBLIGATORIO + 9 RECOMENDABLE + 4 OPCIONAL)
BMad:    69 skills (base flow, untouched)
Anytime: 5 skills (all OPCIONAL — 5 claude-* meta-tooling)
Total:   110 skills
```

`lidr-` is now the consistent prefix for all 36 LIDR-methodology skills (no naked "anytime" entries remain).

_Post-Phase F (gate-over-BMAD cleanup): `lidr-project-classifier` was removed — `bmad-document-project` covers project classification + documentation requirements. Inventory dropped 37→36 LIDR / 111→110 total._
