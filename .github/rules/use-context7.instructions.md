# Use Context7 MCP

Always use Context7 MCP when I need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without me having to explicitly ask.

## When to Use

- Library documentation lookups
- API reference queries
- Code generation from specs
- Setup and configuration steps
- Framework-specific patterns

No need to wait for explicit request—proactively use Context7 for any library/API question.
